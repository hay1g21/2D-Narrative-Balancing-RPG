Boundaries of Resurrection is a 2D RPG made in Unity, featuring an experimental slider which balances gameplay and narrative elements.
The RPG features 6 levels, with turn based combat, items and a level up system. 
The slider allows users to customise their experience, allowing more gameplay elements to take focus or make an easier story centered experience with higher narrative levels.
With higher gameplay, players can focus on building their character stats and challenging enemies while still being able to experience the story through non-intrusive environmental storytelling and ludic elements.
With higher narrative, players can focus on the story, experiencing it with cutscenes and easier gameplay.
